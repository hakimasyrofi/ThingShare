### Problem

Traditional rental marketplaces face significant challenges, including:

- **Centralization and Data Vulnerability**: Item data and user information are stored on centralized servers, making them susceptible to hacks, data loss, or manipulation.
- **Limited Transparency**: Users often struggle to trust platforms due to opaque data handling and unverifiable contracts.
- **Communication Barriers**: Negotiating rental terms, such as pricing, can be cumbersome due to a lack of efficient, secure communication channels between users and hosts.

### Technology Implemented

To address these challenges, our decentralized rental marketplace incorporates:

1. **Filecoin and IPFS for Data Storage**:  
   Decentralized storage solutions are used to securely store item data, such as images and descriptions, ensuring immutability and reliability without relying on centralized servers.

2. **The Graph for Data Indexing**:  
   Efficient indexing of data stored on IPFS allows users to search and query information quickly, improving platform usability.

3. **Blockscout Explorer API for Smart Contract Verification**:  
   Smart contracts are verified using the Blockscout Explorer API, ensuring transparency and enabling users to audit contract functionality independently.

4. **Push Protocol for Communication**:  
   The Push Protocol (formerly EPNS) powers real-time, decentralized communication between users and hosts, facilitating negotiations, such as bargaining for rental prices, securely and efficiently.

### Problem Solved

Our platform resolves the key issues faced by traditional marketplaces by:

- **Ensuring Data Security and Reliability**: Leveraging decentralized storage eliminates the risks associated with centralization, safeguarding user data.
- **Enhancing Transparency**: Verified smart contracts build user trust by guaranteeing transparent operations.
- **Improving Communication**: Secure, decentralized messaging allows users and hosts to negotiate rental terms directly, fostering smoother transactions and better user experiences.

By integrating these technologies, our marketplace creates a decentralized, secure, and user-centric solution for renting items.
